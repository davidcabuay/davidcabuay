### :woman_technologist: About Me :
I am a geotechnical engineer turned web-developer. I've always been drawn to technology and the challenge of problem-solving, which inspired me to explore the world of coding and web development!

After graduating with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Geological Engineering degree and working as a geotechnical engineer for 5 years, I decided to step back and invest in myself by pursuing my interest in coding. I was accepted in App Academy, a top software engineering program with an acceptance rate of less than 3%. During this time, I was able to expand my skillset to include programming languages and frameworks such as React, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and many more.

Aside from coding, I enjoy playing sports during my free time. Growing up in a big family, I particularly enjoy team sports including basketball, football and volleyball during my free time. 

If you are interested in having a chat, please don't hesitate to contact me through LinkedIn or my personal email at david.cabuay@gmail.com. I would love to connect with you!
